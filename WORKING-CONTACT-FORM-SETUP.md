# 🚀 Working Contact Form Setup - GetForm

## 🎯 What I've Done

I've implemented a **working contact form solution** using GetForm that requires minimal setup and will send emails directly to your inbox.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Contact form code updated
- ✅ JavaScript implementation complete  
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Success/failure messages working
- ⏳ **Only 1 step left** - GetForm account setup

## 🔧 Final Setup Step (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GetForm Account
1. Go to **[GetForm.io](https://getform.io)**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** 
3. Use your email: `erhardikmech1012@gmail.com`
4. Verify your email

### Step 2: Create Form Endpoint  
1. In GetForm dashboard, click **"Create Form"**
2. Set **Form Name**: `Harmani Contact Form`
3. Set **Email**: `erhardikmech1012@gmail.com`
4. **Copy the form endpoint URL** (looks like: `https://getform.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)

### Step 3: Update Your Website
1. In your `contact.html` file, find this line:
   ```html
   <form class="contact" id="contact-form" action="https://getform.io/f/aejjekga" method="POST">
   ```

2. Replace `aejjekga` with **your actual form ID** from GetForm

3. In `assets/js/main.js`, find this line:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://getform.io/f/aejjekga', {
   ```

4. Replace `aejjekga` with **your actual form ID**

### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update contact form with actual GetForm endpoint"  
git push
```

## 📧 How It Will Work

1. **Customer fills form** → Form shows "Sending..."
2. **GetForm receives data** → Processes submission  
3. **Email sent to you** → Arrives at `erhardikmech1012@gmail.com`
4. **Success message shown** → Customer sees confirmation
5. **Form resets** → Ready for next inquiry

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you have issues with GetForm setup:
